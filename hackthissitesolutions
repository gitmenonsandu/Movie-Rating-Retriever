basic 1:
	The password was hidden in the source code of the page. ctrl+f and search passsword.. and the password is near one of the results

basic 2:
	It is really common sense as they mentioned. Since the password file was not uploaded, there is no password. Hit submit with a blank field.

basic 3:
	On inspecting element near the field, one can conclude that the password has something to do with /password.php.
	So on appending that to the URL, a new page with the password is obtained

basic 4:
	On inspecting element on the submit button, one can say that the password generated is sent to an email address.
	So on replacing that email id with one of ours, we receive the password on clicking the submit button/

basic 5:
	Same as that of basic 4

basic 6:
	The encrytion is done as follows
	the first character is not changed, the second is incremented by one ASCII value, the third by 2 ASCII values and so on.
	So on reversing the encrypted password given , we get the password.

basic 7:
	Since the unix command's are executed in the given field, i guess giving an 'ls' command should give the password containing file or the password itself. 
	But its giving a blank page,  I haven't figured that out yet.
